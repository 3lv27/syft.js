# syft.js/grid.js Example

In order to get this running, you simply need to run the following:

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`

This will launch a web browser running the file `index.js`. Every time you make changes to this file, the server will automatically re-compile your code and refresh the page. No need to start and stop. :)
